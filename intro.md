### (Unoffical) Working Group for growng Rust on old metal.

The retro working group was founded to provide a home to the plaftforms and targets that fall under "everything else". As our name suggests most of these platforms are old or obsolete. 

Many individuals, seperately have toiled to support rust on a wide variety of platforms, from aging UNIX workstations, to our favourate childhood games consoles. Rust retro is the idea that all of these projects have merit and should have a common home in the rust community, where resources can be pooled and shared as is common in the rest of the Rust community. 

We believe that old machines still have a functional value, beyond the retro gaming scene recently popularised by YouTube, providing you have appropriate software to run on them. This is where we come in. As an accessable systems programmming language strong Rust support may breathe some life into old and forgotten metal, and in a world where sustainabilty is at the tip of everyone's tounges, why not? 

 - Have you ever dreamed of serving webpages from your old DOS machine, 
 - Have you ever wished your C64 was good for more than just being a paperweight?
 - Can you imagine trying to write code to fit 640K again?
